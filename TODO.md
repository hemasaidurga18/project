# TODO List for Hostel Room Booking Platform

## Backend Setup
- [x] Create backend folder and package.json
- [x] Set up Express server (server.js)
- [x] Create MongoDB models (User, Room, Booking)
- [x] Implement authentication middleware
- [x] Create auth routes (register, login)
- [x] Create rooms routes (get rooms, add room, update availability)
- [x] Create bookings routes (get bookings, create booking, cancel booking)
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env)
- [x] Install backend dependencies

## Frontend Setup
- [x] Create frontend folder and package.json
- [x] Set up React app structure (public/index.html, src/index.js, src/App.js)
- [x] Add basic CSS styling (index.css)
- [x] Create Navbar component
- [x] Create Home component
- [x] Create Login component

## Documentation
- [x] Create README.md with setup instructions

## Testing and Deployment
- [x] Test the application locally (Note: MongoDB not installed on system, so backend requires MongoDB to run)
- [x] Ensure MongoDB is running (using in-memory MongoDB for testing)
- [x] Start backend server (running on port 5001)
- [x] Start frontend React app (running on port 3001)
- [x] Verify all features work (API endpoints tested successfully: rooms GET, auth register/login, bookings GET/POST)
- [x] Fix any bugs or issues (none found in code review)
- [ ] Optional: Deploy to a hosting service
